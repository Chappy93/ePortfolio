Evidence is provided here in the following objectives:
1. Explain communication concepts and strategies
- Participated in a Professional Communication Skills for ICT course with CQ University Australia.
- Communication concepts were identified during week 1 of the course. Communicaiton concepts were identified as: Source, The Message, The Channel, The Receiver, Feedback, Environment, Interference, and the Context. Each of these concepts plays an important role in communication.
- Senders and Recievers are importnat as you need to identify who the sender is - yourself or another person. With receivers you identify who the target audience or person is
- The message is determined by the meaning of what is being communicated. Often is is different based on the source and can be interpreted different by the receiver based on the words, tone of your voice, and body language
- The channel is based on how a message is communicated - e.g. by email, text, face-to-face, or a phone call. There can also be 3 differnet types of channels in which communicated can be done - Formal (official), Informal (in-passing), Back Channels (secret communications)
- The receiver of the message can portray the message differently so it is important to determine who your target audience is so that they understand what the source is conveying.
- Feedback is given back to the Source and can often be good or bad, based on the Source, the Message, and the Channel used in communicating.
- Environment is determined by how communication is conducted. Communication can be improved by modifying the environment around you to the message being conveyed. The environment can also be thought of as a face-to-face or online communication.
- Interference is anything that can change the meaning of the message. Interference can be based externally - background noise, internally - thoughts or psychological noise, and the semantics around the message - too much or too little is conveyed to be understood.
- Lastly Context is represented by the audience expectations. It is important to know what the audience expects when you communicate. Having the know of what you are required to communicate, based on the topic, can assist with communicating effectively.
- Communication strategies learnt throughout the unit were verbal and non-verbal. It was identified that different communication strategies are used right arond the world and in every day life in order to help convey messages we give. Verbal strategies can include paraphrasing, acknowledging, and the tone of which we communicate messages. Non-verbal communication can play a big factor is effective communication. Non-verbal communication was identified as body language, gestures, stances, and what we do with our body, such as hands, when someone is communicating with us. There is positive and negative non-verbal communication which can show your audience how you are responding to their message without actually saying anything to them. 

2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations
- Conducted a [practice presentation](Week%207%20-%20Practice&20Presentation.mp4) in week 8 on The Digital Divide for Indigenous Australians via zoom in front of the course lecturer and fellow students to promote effective oral communication skills and practice non-verbal communication during the presentation, whilst demonstrating use of a presentation skills with Microsoft PowerPoint.
- Participated in an [article analysis](11239%20Mob%20Writing.docx) with 3 other students. Conducted a personal analyis and provided self identified information to the group to enable discussion and assisting in the completion of the task.
- Conducted a [conflict management](Wk4%20Conflict%20Scenario.docx) task with another student. Communicated effectively with the other student to provide ideas and different perspectives into conflict resolution strategies in order to work through the conflict scenario and reach a resolution.

3. Work effectively as part of a team
- Participated in a group task during the course tutorial of week 6 practicing [article analysis](11239%20Mob%20Writing.docx). Communicated with the group members by providing summarised analysis of the article and identifying key information throughout the article to complete questions given to each group within a timeframe. =
- Conducted a [conflict management](Wk4%20Conflict%20Scenario.docx) task requiring a two person team to communicate effectively and share ideas and thoughts to deliver the best possible outcome for the conflict scenario. Regardless of being on two different sides during the role-playing scenario, to identify the best conflict strategy to use, healthy discussion was required to be had between both members in order to achieve the goal of finding a resolving conflict and identifying a good resolution strategy.

5. Communicate effectively in a professional context
- Participated in a [conflict management](Wk4%20Conflict%20Scenario.docx) task was conducted during the tutorial. Partnering up with a fellow group member we had to communicate effectively together to role-play through a conflict management scenario. We had to utilise effective communication techniques to discuss the conflict that was involved to identify the appropriate type of conflict management technique to be used to obtain the best possible outcome. Listening skills were needed 
- Conducted an [article analysis](11239%20Mob%20Writing.docx) requiring group members to be able to collate ideas and information to be able to complete the task. While in the zoom meeting, in the group of 4, we each took turns rotating through a driver (person scribing) and 3 navigators (communicating). As a communicator we each took turns providing our input into the analysis which was conducted, which further brainstorming occurred which required collaborative communication to provide the best possible answers for our analysis. We had to communicate effectively by identifying key points and paraphrasing and summarisng each persons input into the analysis.
- Completed a [practice presentation](Week%207%20-%20Practice&20Presentation.mp4) during the week 6 tutorial. The practice presentation was to provide clear and effective communication about a specified topic given to each student. Each student was given a goal to present a minimum 5-minute presentation about the topic of their choosing. Communication was important during the presentation as you were required utilise verbal and non-verbal communication techniques to assist with information interpretation of your specified topic. 

6. Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies
- Participated in an online tutorial via zoom in week 4, where I completed a [conflict management](Wk4%20Conflict%20Scenario.docx) scenario with a fellow student. In the tutorial we role-played a conflict management scenario in which we portrayed characters on competing sides of the the conflict. We utilised interpersonal conflict management styles to discover the best approach in handling the situation by identifying the potential triggers and displaying emotion to show understanding. Resolution strategies were developed by enabling consulation and showing appreciation in attempt to reconcile both parties, in an attempt to prevent further conflict and promote a healthy working relationship.
